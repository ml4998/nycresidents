        <p>Since the termination of their contract in 2021, resident doctors at public hospitals in New York City are at the risk of being paid $5,000 less compared to those working in the private sector

        </p>

        <p>New york City has three different hospital systems: the private sector, safety net public hospitals, and the New York City Health and Hospitals system. TKTK more background info abt the hospital systems.

<p>According to TKTK, a resident at TKTK hospital, the TKTK hospital serves the most vuulenrable patients who are fcaing th ehighets barriers to healthcare aceess such as communities of color, immigrats, refugees, and homeless folks. 

    “It’s kind of incomprehensible why the mayor won’t agree to their [residents’] demands,” TKTK said.
    
    She added that a good number of the resident doctors wokring at public hospitals are immigrants or international students who understand the complexities of cultural realities.
    
    “The diversity of the physician workforce is really a huge asset… When they speak your language, that results in better patient care,” she said.
    
    She added that part of the reason why residents are demanding better salaries is because is they want ot be able to attract physicians from a diverse range of backgrounds to increase the quality of care and equity in th field.

    She added that part of the reason why residents are demanding better salaries is because is they want ot be able to attract physicians from a diverse range of backgrounds to increase the quality of care and equity in th field. 
    
    “They [physicians] have on average over $200,000 instudent loans and that number statistically goes up if you’re from a background that’s statistiaclly underrepresented in medicine, especially Black and Latinx physicians,” she said.
    
    
    She said that resident doctors have not received a response form the mayor, Eric Adams.
    
    “The Mayor and the Office of Labor Relations are who’s ultimately caling the shots. We have not received a response, which is incredibly diappointing,” she said. 
    
    What makes the fight for equity even more difficult for reisdnte is the fact that employees at public hospitals cannot legally strike. However, some of the other ways in which they have tried to keep fighting is through rallies, utility breaks TKTK.
    
    According to her, public hospitals are understaffed to a point where residents are being stretched too thin.
    
    “They [residents] don’t have time to buy healthy food or sleep to make sure pateint care is where it’s supposed to be. The ability to continue to do that is under threat,” she said
    
    According to TKTK resident, all of these problems will ultimately prevent from recemt medical school graduates to from coming to work in New York.
    
    “We are going to miss out on some of the best doctors,” she said.

<p>Last year (tck) residents at Elmhurst hospital went on stirke. Elmhurst hopistal itself is on split payroll (TKTK explain what that means). Evn though th epublic hospital system that’s under the New york City Health and hospiitals is still struggling. The strike at Elmhurst helped the CIR gain more agnecy and exrciese power, according to TKTK resident.

    “Mayor Adams has seen that those doctors are willing to take serious risks, and that even those that cannot strike, they are ready to go. I think that impacts where we stand in terms of leverage and power at the bargaining table,” she said.
    
    Similar to resident 1, resident 2 also emphasize the fact that the campaign is not kust about fair compensation.
    
    “This is about preserving the historic legacy that was able to do what does not happen in the United States—[caring for undocumented and low-income patients]— due to profit-driven care,” TKTK said.
    
    She said that it this future-orineted menatliy that’s inspiring.
